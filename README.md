## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

- I wanted annual salary and monthly totals to auto format to currency. Used toLocaleString() to accomplish this. I also figured out how to limit the decimal point to 2. 
- When I was getting things set up, I couldn't figure out why my table wasn't showing up. After who knows how long I realized I didn't use a closing tag...
- I have been trying to think of ways I could improve my js code, make it cleaner, etc. One example was storing re-used code in a variable. 
- I've enjoyed playing around with styling. Trying to add some new flares when I can.
